Any state tax law has to start in the House and the renewal of the state hospital bed tax this year started in the Senate, which is unconstitutional. The mayor and gubernatorial candidate is correct that tax laws must begin in the House of Representatives.

Also, challenges to the bills constitutionality would be difficult because the Georgia Supreme Court has not overturned legislation that has been duly passed by both houses and signed into law.

"Its entirely possible that the Democratic nominee, [Hillary Clinton], earned more money giving a single speech on Wall Street than I made the six years that I was there back in the 1980s In fact, its quite likely. Pat Toomey said that it was possible and even likely that Hillary Clinton earned more money giving a single speech to a Wall Street bank than he did in his six years there. Clinton earned $260,000 in her most profitable speech to a Wall Street bank, so Toomey would have had to have earned an average of about $43,000 per year on Wall Street. Its possible the entry-level salary for a trader was less than $43,000 in the 1980s, but Toomey was a trader at the forefront of the derivatives operation at Morgan Grenfell. So its likely he earned a significant bonus, which would put his earnings over that threshold. It gets less likely if we adjust Toomeys non-bonus-inflated potential salary for inflation. An annual salary of about $43,000 in 1985 would make significantly more than $260,000 over six years in 2016 dollars. And Toomey didnt just say it was ""possible"" he made less in six years on Wall Street than Clinton did in one speech. He said it was ""likely.

My home state since June of 2009 created 40 percent of the new jobs in America. Our friends at PolitiFact Texas tackled a similar topic when Perry boasted about the states job creation during a GOP presidential debate. It noted that moderator Brian Williams pointed out that Texas has the highest-in-the-nation share of minimum-wage workers. Perrys numbers are on target, but there is some context to consider here. Some of the growth may be attributable to Texas regulations, but there are other factors, such as the states major population growth and the large number of minimum-wage workers. a speech	2	{'subjects': 'jobs', 'speaker': 'rick-perry', 'speaker_title': 'Governor', 'state_info': 'Texas', 'party': 'republican', 'credit_history': {'barely_true': 30, 'false': 30, 'half_true': 42, 'mostly_true': 23, 'pants_fire': 18}}

From 1998 to 2006, as the minimum wage held steady at $5. 15 an hour, the number of workers making at or below that amount declined slightly in Texas, except for a small uptick in 2003. After Congress provided for increases in the federal minimum wage in 2007, 2008 and 2009, more Texans started falling below the wage floor. Workers in 14 other states and the District of Columbia didn't fall to the minimum-wage level or below because their mandatory minimum wage exceeds the federal level.

His new running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a plan that would let Governor Romney pay less than 1 percent in taxes each year. Romney hasnt released his tax returns before 2010, and his 2011 documents arent finalized yet. But, looking at the snapshot of his 2010 return, its safe to say his tax rate would have taken a nose dive. More than $20 million of Romney's $21. 6 million income that year came from interest, dividends and capital gains -- items that would no longer be taxed under Ryans plan. Factor in a reduction in the top marginal tax rate and the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax, and Romneys tax rate would have fallen dramatically, almost surely reaching below 1 percent, according to media reports and tax analyses. a speech at Windham High School in New Hampshire	2	{'subjects': 'taxes', 'speaker': 'barack-obama', 'speaker_title': 'President', 'state_info': 'Illinois', 'party': 'democrat', 'credit_history': {'barely_true': 70, 'false': 71, 'half_true': 160, 'mostly_true': 163, 'pants_fire': 9}}

He included such a detail about Pell Grants, saying ""the year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each.
