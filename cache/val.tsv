Says when armed civilians stop mass shootings with guns, an average of 2.5 people die; otherwise, an average of 18 people die. Rubens said when armed civilians stop mass shootings with guns, an average of 2. 5 people die; otherwise, an average of 18 people die. One of the most comprehensive studies of recent active shooter events suggests the average of 18 deaths when police stop the shooter is far too high. The study of more than 100 incidents determined the median number of people killed or wounded in all active shooter situations was five. The study documented only nine incidents out of dozens in which the number of people shot was 14 or higher. Conclusions about the number of deaths when an armed civilian takes action are also problematic because very limited data exists. The author of the study agrees its logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun. Rubens has since revised his estimate to be in the range of 2. 33 and 14.

Charlie Crist attacks me for positions he held, like, six months ago, (when) he was running in the Republican primary. We've already pretty much written a book about it, noting that his position on oil drilling has shifted, as has his position on the federal health care bill. He once said that he wouldn't run for Senate as an independent, and then said he would support the Republican nominee. But this fact check is about more than flip-flopping. It's about Crist attacking Rubio for the very same positions Crist held just six months ago. There, the case is much more difficult to make. When it comes to health care, Social Security, immigration, embryonic stem cell research and Roe vs.  Wade, we find Crist's positions are either unchanged, or he hasn't used them as a line of attack against Rubio. But gay adoption is a slightly different story. Crist said he supported keeping the gay adoption ban in place as a Republican as recently as eight months ago, but now says he supports the ban being lifted. And he's using that new position to link Rubio to a tea party favorite like Jim DeMint in order to bolster the argument that Rubio's extreme. The caveat is that as far back as 2006 Crist was accused by Republicans of supporting gay adoptions in Florida and has given differing statements on the issue.

Toy revenue is just a portion of Sesame Street's budget and federal funding for Sesame Street is just a portion of the overall issue of federal funding for public broadcasting. But DeMint's figures on Sesame Street toy revenues are right. a blog post	1	{'subjects': 'children,federal-budget', 'speaker': 'jim-demint', 'speaker_title': 'President, Heritage Foundation', 'state_info': 'South Carolina', 'party': 'republican', 'credit_history': {'barely_true': 4, 'false': 4, 'half_true': 0, 'mostly_true': 0, 'pants_fire': 1}}

If you think American presidents should never admit to any sort of error at any time, you might find yourself in philosophical agreement with Romney's criticisms. We set out to discover whether Obama really had apologized in his speeches, and what he was apologizing for. But in our review of his words, we came up short. Yes, there is criticism in some of his speeches, but it's typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and often he mentions other countries and how they have erred as well.

High-speed rail would have cost Florida taxpayers $1 billion to build. If high-speed rail had moved ahead in Florida, Scott said the state would have had to pay $1 billion to build it. While the study correctly points out that other transportation projects have experienced cost overruns, there are several flaws with the study. Most importantly, the study assumes that the state would pay for cost overruns. But that ignores that both the state official in charge of the rail project and the U. S.  Department of Transportation secretary said that the state wouldn't be liable for overruns. And legislators were keen on having it happen that way before fully embracing the high-speed rail line. In the end, the state's share to build the line would have been capped at around $280 million (and legislators hoped the final number would be even less).

The Medicaid expansion is going to cost Florida $1.9 billion a year. In triumphantly declaring that Florida will reject a provision of the federal health care law that expands Medicaid coverage, Gov. Rick Scott told national television audiences that the expansion would cost Florida $1. 9 billion a year. The most recent estimate from the state health care agency says a series of changes to Medicaid could wind up costing about $1. 4 billion a year, but that number includes things beyond the expansion to Medicaid that Scott was talking about. For instance, about $400 million is tied to increased reimbursement payments to Medicaid providers. But the state isn't required to pay that out. And another estimated $516 million will pay for people who are eligible for Medicaid under its current provisions but have not enrolled. They would remain eligible whether or not the program is expanded in Florida. That leaves about $500 million in estimated new costs for Medicaid patients under the federal government expansion. And that cost would not fully kick in until 2020.

On expanding Medicaid as part of the health care law Scott fought the health care law before he became governor, and after the law passed, he continued to fight it. After the Supreme Court upheld the law, Scott said definitively that he opposed the Medicaid expansion. But several months later, in February 2013, Scott announced that he supported Medicaid expansion. He qualified that position by saying he wanted to try it for three years, so Florida could then judge how it was working. But he didnt push the Legislature to approve it, and legislators ultimately rejected the expansion.

Ronald Reagan did amnesty. Alas, the law failed to stop illegal immigration, and many critics of the law say the government never thoroughly regulated employers who skirted the law's requirements. This much is certain: If the law aimed to curb illegal immigration, it failed: When the law was passed, there were about 5-million illegal immigrants; now, there's an estimated 12-million. When Reagan signed the law, many predicted it would encourage the hiring of more migrants, especially outside of agriculture, and that this would spur the backlash against immigration that we're seeing today.

If the legislature refuses to expand Medicaid, 27 states are going to get our money Virginia taxpayer money into their states to provide health care for their citizens, paid for by us.

And if Virginia doesnt join suit, it will sacrifice federal dollars that would pay the overwhelming long-term cost of the expansion. Virginians, like residents of all states, are subject to new taxes to help support the ACA. The payments pour into the U. S.  Treasury where they are mixed with other tax dollars and piped out to federal programs. Theres no tracking of individual coins in this flow of money and its possible that some deposits from Virginia could end up helping Medicaid recipients in other states. But contrary to McAuliffes statement, theres no direct connection between Virginias decision on expansion and what happens to Medicaid in other states.

A study says Massachusetts has lost 18,000 jobs because residents were required to obtain health insurance under an act signed into law by Mitt Romney. In the Dec.  10 debate, Perry cited a study that found increased costs led businesses to create fewer jobs. That is certainly plausible, although we found no other research supporting that figure. More significantly, Perry's statement makes it sound as if the study says existing jobs in Massachusetts were vanquished. Instead, it asserts that 18,000 jobs were not created in the first place.

Two more universities expect students to attend community college first but pay a total of $10,372 or less at both institutions. That leaves seven universities that expect students to earn their $10,000 degrees after corraling up to 87 college credits in other ways that presumably cost additional money.

Speaker Pelosi ... has been busy sticking the taxpayer with her $100,000 bar tab for alcohol on the military jets that shes flying. If Pelosi is to be believed that no alcohol is served on her domestic flights (which account for most of the flights she took as Speaker) and if you agree with FactCheck. org that she took a total of 12 international trips, then the total cost of alcohol would have been something less than $7,000, far lower than Bachmann's $100,000. It's fair game to argue that buying liquor for lawmaker jaunts is an unjustifiable taxpayer expenditure even if perfectly legal. However, if Bachmann wanted to criticize these outlays, she should have read the Judicial Watch news release more closely. Since Bachmann (or her staff) didn't do so, she ended up citing a figure for alcohol expenditures that was close to the much larger number for all non-plane costs of the trip. a speech to the Values Voter Summit	6	{'subjects': 'ethics,government-efficiency', 'speaker': 'michele-bachmann', 'speaker_title': 'Congresswoman', 'state_info': 'Minnesota', 'party': 'republican', 'credit_history': {'barely_true': 8, 'false': 22, 'half_true': 6, 'mostly_true': 4, 'pants_fire': 16}}

"Women account for 92.3 percent of the jobs lost under Obama. Romney's website said that women account for 92. 3 percent of jobs lost under Obama. By comparing job figures with January 2009 and March 2012 and weighing them against womens job figures from the same periods, Saul came up with 92. 3 percent. First, Obama cannot be held entirely accountable for the employment picture on the day he took office, just as he could not be given credit if times had been booming. Second, by choosing figures from January 2009, months into the recession, the statement ignored the millions of jobs lost before then, when most of the job loss fell on men. In every recession, men are the first to take the hit, followed by women. It's a historical pattern, Stevenson told us, not an effect of Obama's policies. Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, said much of the decline for women was in the public sector. ""To the extent there have been excessive job losses among women, a lot of it has to do with the fact that there has been an enormous reduction in state and local government employment,"" Bartlett said. ""The decline . . . has been especially pronounced in this recession as opposed to other recessions. ""This chart from the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed group, bears that out. In earlier recessions, public-sector jobs began increasing again as the economy stabilized. After the most recent recession, they have continued to disappear. Again, these are jobs heavily held by women. Bartlett added that many of those government jobs were eliminated in states controlled by Republican governors and legislatures. This story in the Atlantic cited a study by the liberal Roosevelt Institute finding that the 11 states that went Republican in 2010 accounted for 40. 5 percent of all state and local government job losses. Jeff Hayes is a senior research analyst with the Institute for Womens Policy Research, an organization affiliated with George Washington Universitys public policy graduate program that receives contributions from groups including the Annie E.  Casey Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Hayes added that ""theres a lag before the lost tax revenue catches up and government jobs are lost. ""If you break out the 683,000 jobs women lost between January 2009 and March 2012, 64 percent were in government and only 36 percent in the private sector. ""That leads us to a point made by Eileen Appelbaum with the left-leaning Center on Economic and Policy Research. She noted that after the first wave of money in the presidents stimulus bill had run out, Obama asked for another $23 billion in ""emergency aid"" for state and local governments. The money was sought to avert the layoffs of as many as 300,000 public school teachers, but House Republican leaders stripped it. ""You could hardly blame Obama for that,"" Appelbaum said. As for the comparison with the PolitiFact Georgia item, such direct comparisons are tricky. The Associated Press said using the 92. 3 percent figure as a measure of Obamas record on women was ""dubious at best. ""First Read, a politics blog by NBC News, had this to say: ""Does anyone believe, with a straight face, that nine in 10 job losses over the past three years have been women workers? ""And the New York Times disputed the emphasis on the job losses occurring ""under Obama. """"Presidents get too much credit or blame for changes in the business cycle. Contrary to what seems to be popular opinion, neither Mr.  Bush nor Mr.  Obama had or have the unilateral ability to steer the country into good or bad job markets. Neither would a President Romney,"" Times economics writer Catherine Rampell wrote in the Economix blog. Well conclude with this point: Experts agree that the economic recovery has not helped women as much as men. Howard Wall, an economics professor at Lindenwood University, said its fair to fault Obama for that. ""I think you have to kind of divide the timeline. Call it the Bush recession and the Obama recovery,"" Wall said. ""I dont give them (the Obama administration) credit for stopping the fall or causing the fall. They had nothing to do with that.

UPDATE, Feb.  29, 2016: After we published this story, a reader pointed us to a memoir by Pershing titled My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917, which was republished in 2013 by the University Press of Kentucky. In the memoir, Pershing writes that another commanding officer in the Philippines, Col.  Frank West, had in at least one case seen to it that bodies of Muslim insurgents ""were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins. ""In a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T.  Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj.  Gen.  J.  Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: ""Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom.

The plan would be paid for by cost savings and tax increases on the top 5 percent of income earners, an increased payroll tax, and taxes on stock and bond transactions.

Says the Democrats told the Catholic Church that theyll use federal powers to shut down church charities and hospitals if the church doesnt change its beliefs.

The richest 400 taxpayers are taxed at a lower rate than a $29,000-a-year worker Although IRS spokeswoman Peggy Riley said those taxes are not factored into the IRS analysis, we understand the point of including them because the Social Security tax, in particular, has a significant impact on low- and middle-income people. According to calculations by Whitehouses office -- which match our own -- when you include Social Security and Medicare taxes, the effective tax rate for the wealthiest 400 Americans would have been 16. 72 percent in 2007; the tax rate for a worker earning $29,000 a year would have been 16. 79 percent. In short, Whitehouse accurately reported the IRS's most recent summary of its top 400 tax filers, even if he incorrectly cited the year of the report. When we audited his suggestion that the super-rich pay a lower rate than someone making just $29,000, we concluded he's right if you include all payroll taxes, but off by about $40,000 if you only consider income tax, as the IRS report does. a speech 	2	{'subjects': 'income,taxes', 'speaker': 'sheldon-whitehouse', 'speaker_title': 'U.S. Senator', 'state_info': 'Rhode Island', 'party': 'democrat', 'credit_history': {'barely_true': 2, 'false': 3, 'half_true': 2, 'mostly_true': 7, 'pants_fire': 0}}

A bill to eliminate Delta Air Lines jet fuel tax breaks violates federal law and puts the state at risk of losing critical funding from the Federal Aviation Administration. He bases that on federal laws stating that aviation fuel taxes must be used for airports or aviation purposes and an FAA policy statement last November, clarifying the agencys position and giving governments no more than three years to adjust. We know this: Georgia lawmakers have been passing jet fuel tax exemptions for Delta since 2005, when the airlines was in dire financial trouble. Since Banstetter made his statement, Ehrhart has said hes developing a plan that would allow the tax money to go to aviation uses by the FAAs three-year deadline.

"Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler opposed an injunction to stop a company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer. Rockwell said Adler opposed an injunction to stop a ""company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer. ""Adler, representing Lowes in court, opposed a successful push by the City of Sunset Valley and environmental groups to get a temporary injunction to stop Lowes from continuing to build a store over the aquifer. In a hearing, an expert for the plaintiffs testified about observing a hydrocarbon sheen being part of runoff flowing from the site onto underground limestone and, significantly, the judges order in response said Lowes should address any oil spills. So, Adler sought to keep a project going that on the day before the hearing appeared to one engineer to be sending runoff with an oily sheen directly underground. However, there is vital missing context in that the legal fight wasnt rooted in letting Lowes dump -- or stopping Lowes from dumping -- petrochemicals.

Since the Democrats stimulus went into effect last year, Ohio has lost about 150,000 Jobs. Portmans campaign later offered The Plain Dealer conflicting citations for the figures in both statements, and for the time-frame examined, making it difficult to pin down how and when they computed the figure. In the end, the number of jobs lost cited in Portmans June 30 statement is inflated and not close enough to be considered a difference that can be attributed to rounding. Furthermore, while the campaign is correct that jobs have been lost since the stimulus was passed, its release ignores important context: Ohio has started to see net job gains in recent months, albeit small, contradicting a suggestion that the stimulus bill is causing job losses. a news release	3	{'subjects': 'economy,jobs,stimulus', 'speaker': 'rob-portman', 'speaker_title': 'U.S. senator from Ohio', 'state_info': 'Ohio', 'party': 'republican', 'credit_history': {'barely_true': 3, 'false': 5, 'half_true': 11, 'mostly_true': 11, 'pants_fire': 1}}

Social Security and other federal checks may not go out on Aug. 3 if the debt ceiling is not increased. While it's not a certainty that the Obama administration could prioritize cutting checks to seniors, there's a reasonable shot that the administration could do it.
