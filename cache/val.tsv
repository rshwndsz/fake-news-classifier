5	9416.json	false	Says when armed civilians stop mass shootings with guns, an average of 2.5 people die; otherwise, an average of 18 people die.	guns	jim-rubens	Small business owner	New Hampshire	republican	1	1	0	1	0	in an interview at gun shop in Hudson, N.H.	Rubens said when armed civilians stop mass shootings with guns, an average of 2. 5 people die; otherwise, an average of 18 people die. One of the most comprehensive studies of recent active shooter events suggests the average of 18 deaths when police stop the shooter is far too high. The study of more than 100 incidents determined the median number of people killed or wounded in all active shooter situations was five. The study documented only nine incidents out of dozens in which the number of people shot was 14 or higher. Conclusions about the number of deaths when an armed civilian takes action are also problematic because very limited data exists. The author of the study agrees its logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun. Rubens has since revised his estimate to be in the range of 2. 33 and 14. Overall, this statement is not accurate.

He once said that he wouldn't run for Senate as an independent, and then said he would support the Republican nominee. But this fact check is about more than flip-flopping. It's about Crist attacking Rubio for the very same positions Crist held just six months ago. There, the case is much more difficult to make. When it comes to health care, Social Security, immigration, embryonic stem cell research and Roe vs.  Wade, we find Crist's positions are either unchanged, or he hasn't used them as a line of attack against Rubio. But gay adoption is a slightly different story. Crist said he supported keeping the gay adoption ban in place as a Republican as recently as eight months ago, but now says he supports the ban being lifted. And he's using that new position to link Rubio to a tea party favorite like Jim DeMint in order to bolster the argument that Rubio's extreme. The caveat is that as far back as 2006 Crist was accused by Republicans of supporting gay adoptions in Florida and has given differing statements on the issue. In that case, Crist's flip-flopping helps his argument.

In that scenario, millionaires lose deductions, but the lower rates would still decrease their tax bill by an average of $87,000. Middle-class taxpayers would see lower tax rates, too, but the loss of exemptions and deductions would hit them harder. People making $200,000 or less a year would see their taxes rise by an average of about $2,000. The study is making the point that Romneys plan is untenable: to cut rates that much without adding to the deficit, something has to give. It necessarily makes some assumptions, and therefore these conclusions are not definite as long as the details of the plan remain unknown. For that reason, people should be cautious in calling this Romney's plan."

We set out to discover whether Obama really had apologized in his speeches, and what he was apologizing for. But in our review of his words, we came up short.

As for religious affiliations, all of the signers were Protestant Christians with one exception, Charles Carroll of Maryland, who was Roman Catholic.

Wentworth says Campbell is pushing a 35 percent sales tax extending to medicine, groceries and real estate. While running for Congress in 2010, Campbell spoke out in favor of a possible 23 percent federal sales tax in return for wiping out federal income taxes. In the same spirit, she now supports replacing property tax revenue collected across Texas with income from the state sales tax. By itself, that move could drive the state sales tax rate to 14 percent or so. Then again, the conditions her campaign lays out could be taken as signals shes not ready to embrace any sudden surge or broadening of the tax.

"Allen, trying to refute charges he voted to run up federal deficits, said the U. S.  was ""on a trajectory towards a balanced budget"" when he left the Senate in 2007. Allens campaign cites a 2007 CBO report that said Washington was on the road to budget surpluses, starting in 2012. But those projections were based on the assumption that the Bush tax cuts would end as scheduled in 2010. And Allen has maintained since at least 2006 that the tax reductions should be made permanent. Had Allen prevailed on the tax cuts, figures in the 2007 CBO report point to the deficit slowly rising in raw dollars over the next eight years. The deficit, as a percentage of GDP, would have been only a smidgen lower in 2015 than it was in 2007. So Allen is right that the U. S.  was projected to be on a trajectory towards a balanced budget when his Senate term ended. But he omits a key detail that creates a different impression: the projected path towards a balanced budget required a step Allen refused to take -- ending the Bush tax cuts."

277	4261.json	false	High-speed rail would have cost Florida taxpayers $1 billion to build.	transportation	rick-scott	Governor	Florida	republican	28	23	38	34	7	TV interview	If high-speed rail had moved ahead in Florida, Scott said the state would have had to pay $1 billion to build it. While the study correctly points out that other transportation projects have experienced cost overruns, there are several flaws with the study. Most importantly, the study assumes that the state would pay for cost overruns. But that ignores that both the state official in charge of the rail project and the U. S.  Department of Transportation secretary said that the state wouldn't be liable for overruns. And legislators were keen on having it happen that way before fully embracing the high-speed rail line. In the end, the state's share to build the line would have been capped at around $280 million (and legislators hoped the final number would be even less). You can't rewrite history to fit your narrative.

Rick Scott told national television audiences that the expansion would cost Florida $1. 9 billion a year. The most recent estimate from the state health care agency says a series of changes to Medicaid could wind up costing about $1. 4 billion a year, but that number includes things beyond the expansion to Medicaid that Scott was talking about. For instance, about $400 million is tied to increased reimbursement payments to Medicaid providers. But the state isn't required to pay that out. And another estimated $516 million will pay for people who are eligible for Medicaid under its current provisions but have not enrolled. They would remain eligible whether or not the program is expanded in Florida. That leaves about $500 million in estimated new costs for Medicaid patients under the federal government expansion. And that cost would not fully kick in until 2020. So yes, the Medicaid expansion will cost the state.

Other nicks in Perrys statement: These results are preliminary and might prove unreliable. Also, by another measure, comparing the number of graduates one year to students in ninth grade four years earlier, Texas remained among middling states for 2009-10, with a 79 percent completion rate. Finally, since it's not accurate to compare these rates devised in different ways, Perrys reference to a ""significant turnaround"" depends on just the three years of rates measured in the newest way. But in this time window, there is no indication the rate was either stuck or plummeting before 2011, so the latest results do not indicate a turnaround. All told, Texas graduation rates are improving and the state looks strong compared to most others."

Alas, the law failed to stop illegal immigration, and many critics of the law say the government never thoroughly regulated employers who skirted the law's requirements. This much is certain: If the law aimed to curb illegal immigration, it failed: When the law was passed, there were about 5-million illegal immigrants; now, there's an estimated 12-million. When Reagan signed the law, many predicted it would encourage the hiring of more migrants, especially outside of agriculture, and that this would spur the backlash against immigration that we're seeing today. Giuliani, it would seem, brought up Reagan's legacy to show how difficult the immigration issue is.

McAuliffe said that the General Assemblys refusal to expand Medicaid would send Virginia taxpayers money into 27 other states to insure their working poor. Hes right that 27 states have broadened Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. And if Virginia doesnt join suit, it will sacrifice federal dollars that would pay the overwhelming long-term cost of the expansion. Virginians, like residents of all states, are subject to new taxes to help support the ACA. The payments pour into the U. S.  Treasury where they are mixed with other tax dollars and piped out to federal programs. Theres no tracking of individual coins in this flow of money and its possible that some deposits from Virginia could end up helping Medicaid recipients in other states. But contrary to McAuliffes statement, theres no direct connection between Virginias decision on expansion and what happens to Medicaid in other states. The goal of expansion is to offer Medicaid insurance to people earning up 133 percent of the U. S.  poverty line. States participating in the program will receive the same federal subsidy for each new enrollee regardless of whether Virginia participates.

Two more universities expect students to attend community college first but pay a total of $10,372 or less at both institutions. That leaves seven universities that expect students to earn their $10,000 degrees after corraling up to 87 college credits in other ways that presumably cost additional money. Several also require students following the $10,000 degree plans to have income-based Pell grants or to qualify for other scholarships.

But when we ran this past Mark Robyn, the foundations staff economist, he cautioned that the 2007 chart is outdated. More recently, a 2009 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows Texas with state spending of $3,630 per person compared to the national average of $5,038--an indication that Texas would have had to increase its spending 39 percent that year to reach the national average. A footnote to the foundations research posted online says the spending figures were obtained from the National Association of State Budget Officers. DeLuna of the Austin center said the NASBO total doesnt take into account some Texas spending that the census bureau counted, such as extra money for state universities and Food Stamp benefits.

It's fair game to argue that buying liquor for lawmaker jaunts is an unjustifiable taxpayer expenditure even if perfectly legal. However, if Bachmann wanted to criticize these outlays, she should have read the Judicial Watch news release more closely. Since Bachmann (or her staff) didn't do so, she ended up citing a figure for alcohol expenditures that was close to the much larger number for all non-plane costs of the trip.

907	5713.json	barely-true	Women account for 92.3 percent of the jobs lost under Obama.	corrections-and-updates,jobs,women	mitt-romney	Former governor	Massachusetts	republican	34	32	58	33	19	Mitt Romney's website	"Romney's website said that women account for 92. 3 percent of jobs lost under Obama. By comparing job figures with January 2009 and March 2012 and weighing them against womens job figures from the same periods, Saul came up with 92. 3 percent. First, Obama cannot be held entirely accountable for the employment picture on the day he took office, just as he could not be given credit if times had been booming. Second, by choosing figures from January 2009, months into the recession, the statement ignored the millions of jobs lost before then, when most of the job loss fell on men. In every recession, men are the first to take the hit, followed by women. It's a historical pattern, Stevenson told us, not an effect of Obama's policies. Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, said much of the decline for women was in the public sector. ""To the extent there have been excessive job losses among women, a lot of it has to do with the fact that there has been an enormous reduction in state and local government employment,"" Bartlett said. ""The decline . . . has been especially pronounced in this recession as opposed to other recessions. ""This chart from the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed group, bears that out. In earlier recessions, public-sector jobs began increasing again as the economy stabilized. After the most recent recession, they have continued to disappear. Again, these are jobs heavily held by women. Bartlett added that many of those government jobs were eliminated in states controlled by Republican governors and legislatures. This story in the Atlantic cited a study by the liberal Roosevelt Institute finding that the 11 states that went Republican in 2010 accounted for 40. 5 percent of all state and local government job losses. Jeff Hayes is a senior research analyst with the Institute for Womens Policy Research, an organization affiliated with George Washington Universitys public policy graduate program that receives contributions from groups including the Annie E.  Casey Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Hayes added that ""theres a lag before the lost tax revenue catches up and government jobs are lost. ""If you break out the 683,000 jobs women lost between January 2009 and March 2012, 64 percent were in government and only 36 percent in the private sector. ""That leads us to a point made by Eileen Appelbaum with the left-leaning Center on Economic and Policy Research. She noted that after the first wave of money in the presidents stimulus bill had run out, Obama asked for another $23 billion in ""emergency aid"" for state and local governments. The money was sought to avert the layoffs of as many as 300,000 public school teachers, but House Republican leaders stripped it. ""You could hardly blame Obama for that,"" Appelbaum said. As for the comparison with the PolitiFact Georgia item, such direct comparisons are tricky. The Associated Press said using the 92. 3 percent figure as a measure of Obamas record on women was ""dubious at best. ""First Read, a politics blog by NBC News, had this to say: ""Does anyone believe, with a straight face, that nine in 10 job losses over the past three years have been women workers? ""And the New York Times disputed the emphasis on the job losses occurring ""under Obama. """"Presidents get too much credit or blame for changes in the business cycle. Contrary to what seems to be popular opinion, neither Mr.  Bush nor Mr.  Obama had or have the unilateral ability to steer the country into good or bad job markets. Neither would a President Romney,"" Times economics writer Catherine Rampell wrote in the Economix blog. Well conclude with this point: Experts agree that the economic recovery has not helped women as much as men. Howard Wall, an economics professor at Lindenwood University, said its fair to fault Obama for that. ""I think you have to kind of divide the timeline. Call it the Bush recession and the Obama recovery,"" Wall said. ""I dont give them (the Obama administration) credit for stopping the fall or causing the fall. They had nothing to do with that. But they own the recovery. ""Does all this mean that Obamas policies have brought hard times to women"

The report says the ratio is useful for comparing different states and countries. In an interview, Moodys analyst Nicole Johnson said that a relatively low ratio generally means a state has more flexibility to increase its debt than states with high ratios. So, Texas has the least state debt per capita among the most populous states, as Perry says, and by Moodys accounting the 12th lowest of all states. Perry incorrectly said it was fourth-lowest of all states, but his meaning holds up; Texas is a relatively low-debt state.

1210	102.json	false	I was the first presidential candidate to lay out a specific, truly universal health care plan.	health-care	john-edwards	former senator	North Carolina	democrat	0	2	4	4	1	Hanover, N.H.	It was introduced in the House in 2005, though Kucinich supported an earlier version during his previous run for president in 2004. It would provide free health care for all, including primary care, prescription drugs, and mental health services. The plan would be paid for by cost savings and tax increases on the top 5 percent of income earners, an increased payroll tax, and taxes on stock and bond transactions. The legislation has little chance of passing, but it's still fairly specific and it's certainly universal.

1215	7574.json	pants-fire	Says the Democrats told the Catholic Church that theyll use federal powers to shut down church charities and hospitals if the church doesnt change its beliefs.	health-care,religion,sexuality	ted-cruz	Senator	Texas	republican	36	33	15	19	8	a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference	Cruz, alluding to Obamacares contraception insurance coverage mandate, said Democrats told the Catholic Church they would use federal powers to shut down its charities and hospitals if the church doesnt change its beliefs. We found no sign of such a statement -- or anything close. The Catholic bishops have said that potential accumulated fines resulting from refusals to carry out the contraception mandate will cause some institutions to shut down. However, such prospects do not reflect a direct threat from Democrats or the government. To the contrary, the administration has moved to widen the mandates exemption for religious employers and provide a workaround for those who act as their own insurance providers -- with the goal of allowing affected parties to continue their work without violating or changing their beliefs.

According to calculations by Whitehouses office -- which match our own -- when you include Social Security and Medicare taxes, the effective tax rate for the wealthiest 400 Americans would have been 16. 72 percent in 2007; the tax rate for a worker earning $29,000 a year would have been 16. 79 percent. In short, Whitehouse accurately reported the IRS's most recent summary of its top 400 tax filers, even if he incorrectly cited the year of the report. When we audited his suggestion that the super-rich pay a lower rate than someone making just $29,000, we concluded he's right if you include all payroll taxes, but off by about $40,000 if you only consider income tax, as the IRS report does.

1270	11101.json	half-true	The federal deficit would pay for 40 gallons of New Hampshire maple syrup for everyone in the United States.	deficit,population,states	kelly-ayotte	U.S. Senator	New Hampshire	republican	2	1	1	4	0	a town hall meeting in Colebrook, N.H.	U. S.  Sen.  Kelly Ayotte said the federal budget deficit is big enough to be able to buy 40 gallons of maple syrup for every resident of the United States. Ayottes office said she was calculating it based on generic U. S. -made syrup, but thats considerably less expensive than New Hampshire-made syrup. If we were buying New Hampshire syrup wholesale using 2014 prices, the amount would come closer, but still not hit a full 40 gallons. And if we use retail costs in New Hampshire, it works out to 26 gallons, not 40. So her numbers are open to question, but her general point is valid: Either figure represents more than a lifetime supply for the average maple muncher in America.
1272	4104.json	half-true	Social Security and other federal checks may not go out on Aug. 3 if the debt ceiling is not increased.	deficit,federal-budget,social-security	barack-obama	President	Illinois	democrat	70	71	160	163	9	an interview with CBS News	While it's not a certainty that the Obama administration could prioritize cutting checks to seniors, there's a reasonable shot that the administration could do it. On the other hand, doing so would likely cause a lot of collateral damage to other American creditors, federal workers, students, Pentagon vendors and countless others -- and could also hamper the broader economy at a particularly sensitive time. The president is probably justified in saying that the possibility of an un-raised debt ceiling jeopardizes Social Security checks -- after all, it hasn't happened before, so no one knows for sure. But we also think the president probably has tools at his disposal to avoid the worst-case scenario for seniors that he expresses concern about.

""Little variances on the numbers aside, we take issue with the suggestion that TSA grew from 16,500 to a bulging 67,000-employee bureaucracy. TSA may have had 16,500 screeners in its infancy, but it was created with the idea that it would have many more. Mica is cherry-picking some numbers in his statement."

"Huckabee, who like McCain has accused fellow candidates of insufficient support for the troop surge, initially had qualms. Shortly after the surge was announced, for example, Huckabee told MSNBC's Norah O'Donnell that he wasn't sure he could support the troop increases in Iraq if it meant calling up more National Guard and Reserve forces. He now says he firmly supports Bush's military tactics in Iraq, and recently wrote in     Foreign Affairs    magazine that he would ""not withdraw U. S.  troops from Iraq any faster than General David Petraeus, the top U. S.  commander there, recommends. ""There's no doubt that McCain is the surge's most powerful advocate among the candidates, and has been from the start."
